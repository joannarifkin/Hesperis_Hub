Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation: We used an I. purpurea line originally sampled from NC in 1985 by M. Rausher and selfed for >18 generations in the lab for genome sequencing (seeds available upon request). High molecular weight DNA was isolated using a modified large-volume CTAB protocol (Doyle & Doyle, 1990) and sequenced on a PacBio Sequel at the University of Georgia. Raw PacBio subreads from 9 cells of Sequel chemistry were error-corrected with Canu (v1.7.1) (Koren et al., 2017) with default parameters for raw PacBio reads (--pacbio-raw). The corrected and trimmed reads from Canu were assembled with Flye (v2.4-release) (Kolmogorov et al., 2019) and anchored onto pseudomolecules by nearly 81 million read pairs of Phase Genomics Hi-C (Seattle, WA) of leaf tissue using Sau3AI cutsites. Within-genome and across-genome synteny was visualized using the CoGE SynMap platform (Lyons, 2008), with DAGChainer options â€œ-D20 -A 5", as well as with jcvi with default parameters (https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi). Ipomoea purpurea pseudomolecules were numbered and oriented according to chromosome synteny against Ipomoea nil pseudomolecules.
Raw 50nt single-end RNA-seq reads (Josephs et al., 2021) were aligned using STAR (v.2.7.0) (Dobin et al., 2013) with default single-pass parameters. Repetitive elements were annotated with RepeatModeler (v1.0.11). Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were annotated with LTRharvest (v1.6.1) with options -similar 85 -mindistltr 1000 -maxdistltr 15000 -mintsd 5 -maxtsd 20". RepeatModeler annotations were combined with all Viridiplantae repeats from Repbase and used as a species-specific repeat database built using RepeatModeler with default options.
Genome annotation was performed using a diverse set of evidence. First, a set of 12 RNA-seq libraries from leaf tissue (Van Etten et al., 2021) was aligned with STAR (v2.7.0), and transcripts assembled with Stringtie (v2.1.3). MAKER2 (Holt & Yandell, 2011) was initially run with evidence from the RNA-seq alignments, as well as peptides from I. trifida, I. triloba, and I. nil. The resulting gene set was used to train SNAP (v2013-11-29). AUGUSTUS (v3.3.2) was trained with evidence from BUSCO (v4.1.0) against the eudicot odb10 set. with default options. MAKER2 was re-run with the ab initio SNAP and AUGUSTUS training sets, in addition to the homologous protein and RNA-seq evidence, to build a final gene annotation set.
